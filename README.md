## Task List:

- [ ] Basic AI with a preset deck
- [ ] Deck/Lineup creation screen
- [ ] Data Metrics when game concludes
- [ ] Load from Preset Loadouts (in form of JSON)
- [ ] Hiding Player 2 Information if playing with AI
- [ ] "Functionize" some of the End of Turn and End of Combat (would need to rearrange the character.json build)
- [ ] Energy
- [ ] Think of how to resolve multiple conditions in a single combat action, especially if it's an OR conditional (ie. Eager OR 1/2). This will likely need to rearrange character.json build.
- [ ] Improve visibility/design of character card text
- [ ] Reorganize the code base for better code management
- [ ] Add better visual feedback for dealing DMG
- [ ] Add visual feedback for temporary "buffs"
